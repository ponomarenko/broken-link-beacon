```

For instance, to extract all links from 2 first URLs appeared in github.com:

```
python link_extractor.py https://github.com -m 2
```

This will result in a large list, here is the last 5 links:

```
[!] External link: https://developer.github.com/
[*] Internal link: https://help.github.com/
[!] External link: https://github.blog/
[*] Internal link: https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/
[*] Internal link: https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/
[+] Total Internal links: 85
[+] Total External links: 21
[+] Total URLs: 106
```

This will also save these URLs in `github.com_external_links.txt` for external links and `github.com_internal_links.txt` for internal links.
